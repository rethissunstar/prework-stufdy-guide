            CSS can format inline, internal or external
          </li>
          <li>
            by using link we can add the stylesheet to the HTML code "--link rel="stylesheet" href="./locationfolder/filename.css--"" remove the --
          </li>
          <li>
            in the stylesheet we put the formatting tags such as margin and padding - don't confuse them as padding applies to an element
          </li>
          <li>
            we also declared header, footer at the same time and declared width and height of the header and footer the background colour and the colour of the text in the box
          </li>
          <li>
            we aligned the text using h1, h2 and the text-align command with the parameter :center; we should also note that the li element has a word wrap feature
          </li>
          <li>
            we have leaned creating a card allows us to disgnate as a class sector and the any HTML that is assigned to the class will gain these peoperties
          </li>
          <li>
            we can then dictate the properties of the card using the border, margin, width and also the box-shadow which gives a 3d look the parameters for this is the x and y offests which causes that shadow like effect first is x and then second is y declared as pixels.

          <li>
            Github is a version system for tracking builds and for collaboration.
            It's purpose exists as a way to track changes and not affect the live while being able to see what is happening with your code.

          </li>
          <li>
            "git checkout main" allows us to get back to the main branch - this lets us update to the main
            
          </li>
          <li>
            "git checkout - b iputinname/subfolder" allows us to create a new branch.

          </li>
          <li>
            "git status" allow us to know where the hell we are.
          </li>

        <h3>committing changes to git to be made live</h3>

          1. this is testing ordered list so I can see how it works
        </ol>
        <ol>
          2. so it really does require that we place each in the tag so that we get a new entry.  It ignores the whitespace.
        </ol>
        <ol> 
          we use git add -A

        </ol>
        <ol>
          git commit -m "enter the message of what you are committing"
        </ol>
        <ol>
          git pull origin main  - note you should be in your feature branch. This puts us in the main
        </ol>
        <ol>
          git push origin "name of the branch"
